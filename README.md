# Codio Python Project Template
This starterpack serves as a template for Python projects in Codio.

## Open hello_world.py via file tree
Click on the hello_world.py file in the file tree to open it in the code editor.

You can right-click in the file tree to rename this file or delete it and start from a new file (see below).

## Run
Use the Run button (that looks like a Rocketship) to Run the file your cursor is in.

## Reconfigure your Panels for easier development
Use the **View > Panels** menu on the top tool bar to segment your screen.

Simply drag the tab of the file or terminal (the part with the name) you want to move into the new panel.

## Make a new file
Use **File > New File...** or right-click in the file tree to create a new file.

As Codio detects which file is in focus, simply put your cursor into whichever code editor you want to run.
